# ElonaPlusDialogueProject
This is an add-on, or mod2, or modmod for Elona Plus Custom. 
My end goal is to add more variety and life to the game, with dialogue that feels as if it was built around the game proper.

**Installation:**
Make a backup of talk.txt; mosey this talk.txt over it, and enjoy.
Feel free to replace the game with the backup if your text isn't working right, or you don't like it.

**Thanks:**
Big ups to everyone who has ever worked on Elona, +, the wiki, the translation, and everything to do with this crazy game in some capacity.
Ruin and the crew, Glyphy, Ano. To everyone I've interacted with over the years and been a bad digital compadre to; you're all amazing.
AnnaBanana, to her re-enabling the story content for us storyhounds, and BloodyShade for updating those updates.
Everyone who made Custom, well, Custom; most of all to Noa, for making a game that has probably given me more over these weird years than any other.
Thanks for reading this far. Be kind, to others, and to yourself.
